                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        I was born in Argentina, grew up in New York City, and attended school in the Bronx. 
                        I have a deep appreciation for Argentine cuisine and often find myself craving our traditional dishes. 
                        I'm an avid lover of video games, movies, and dining out at diverse restaurants. 
                        I've traveled to 15 cities across 10 states, always eager to explore and learn about different places.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Currently, I play a pivotal role in a financial company that houses 10,000 employees. 
                        I supervise a fantastic team of 25, ensuring everything received in the building is accurately accounted for 
                        and promptly delivered to our valued colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        I absolutely love my job! It might not be all techy, but it's incredibly fulfilling. 
                        I'm passionate about keeping things organized and making sure everyone gets what they need. 
                        I've also made attempts to understand the financial side of our company, though I admit it's a lot to take in!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Just a heads up: I appreciate genuine interactions. If you're genuine and friendly, you'll find that I'm always ready to lend a hand. 
                        Respect and kindness are the currencies I believe in. I love being of assistance, just as much as I enjoy diving into a new video game
                        or discovering a hidden gem of a restaurant... That's a little snippet from the tale of my life :)
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        P.S. If you ever want recommendations on video games, movies, or Argentine dishes, I'm your go-to!

                    <h3>Project 1</h3>
                        
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        During my time at CUNY SPS, there's one project that really stands out. It's not the most complex or impressive piece of code, 
                        but it's special to me because it's the first time I felt like coding could truly simplify life. 
                        This project is a simple Python program—a blood pressure checker.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        The idea behind it was simple too: create a tool that anyone, especially those not familiar with medical jargon, 
                        could use to monitor their blood pressure. We wanted to make it easy, especially for older folks who might find traditional 
                        blood pressure readings confusing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        Here's how it works: you input your systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, the two key numbers for assessing your 
                        blood pressure health. The program then gives you a straightforward, easy-to-understand interpretation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        If your blood pressure is in the healthy range, you get a reassuring message like "Your blood pressure is normal. 
                        Keep up the good work!" It's a small thing, but it can bring peace of mind to anyone worried about their health.
                        But if the readings suggest a potential health issue, the program gently advises you to consult a doctor. 
                        Sometimes, that gentle nudge can be lifesaving.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        For me, this project was a turning point. It was the first time I created code that felt genuinely practical and meaningful in the real world.
                        It wasn't the most advanced code, but it showed me the incredible potential of coding. It's not just about algorithms and syntax; 
                        it's about solving real-world problems and making a positive impact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        As I look back on this project, I can't help but smile. It might be a simple beginner's project, 
                        but it reminds me that even small coding projects can have a big impact. It taught me that coding is a tool for simplifying
                        complex aspects of life, one line of code at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        So, if you ever find yourself struggling with a blood pressure monitor or facing any other everyday challenge, 
                        remember that coding can be the key to making life a little bit easier. It's not just about the code itself; 
                        it's about the difference it can make in people's lives..</p>

                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        Jumping into this school project was like a cool adventure, imagining what-if scenarios with the Local Express Delivery Company 
                        as our creative sandbox. We pretended it started back in 2003 and used it to dig into how drones could shake up the package delivery game.                         
                        I got really into picturing a future where drones are buzzing around instead of delivery trucks, especially as tech gets better every day.
                        We looked at how Amazon is doing things and dreamed up a scene where drones are zipping through the sky, dropping off packages in far-off 
                        places super fast—like a 13-minute delivery run in Cambridgeshire.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        I dived into the money-saving and green benefits of our made-up drone program, kind of like the big dreams tech whizzes have. 
                        The project had me figuring out all the nitty-gritty, like how much stuff costs, training people to fly drones, and dealing 
                        with all the rules about flying. I cooked up solutions that felt like the real tough choices businesses face, like shifting 
                        budgets around and changing what jobs people do. It was all about thinking ahead and making smart moves.
                    </p>
    
                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        But this project was more than just coming up with strategies; it was a story about rolling with the punches and what the future of 
                        work might look like. It gave us the chance to write a new chapter on how business and caring for the planet can go hand in hand, 
                        mixing serious study with wild creativity that you usually get to play with in school.
                    </p>    

                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        Looking back, it's clear that we weren't just guessing about what a company's future might hold; we were also getting our heads 
                        around how progress works, blending new ideas with what actually makes sense. Even though we made up the strategies and tech, 
                        it showed how school can get us pumped to think up new ideas. This wasn't just homework; it was a journey through imagination and 
                        the kind of forward-thinking that pushes us forward.
