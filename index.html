                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        I was born in Argentina, grew up in New York City, and attended school in the Bronx. 
                        I have a deep appreciation for Argentine cuisine and often find myself craving our traditional dishes. 
                        I'm an avid lover of video games, movies, and dining out at diverse restaurants. 
                        I've traveled to 15 cities across 10 states, always eager to explore and learn about different places.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Currently, I play a pivotal role in a financial company that houses 10,000 employees. 
                        I supervise a fantastic team of 25, ensuring everything received in the building is accurately accounted for 
                        and promptly delivered to our valued colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        I absolutely love my job! It might not be all techy, but it's incredibly fulfilling. 
                        I'm passionate about keeping things organized and making sure everyone gets what they need. 
                        I've also made attempts to understand the financial side of our company, though I admit it's a lot to take in!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Just a heads up: I appreciate genuine interactions. If you're genuine and friendly, you'll find that I'm always ready to lend a hand. 
                        Respect and kindness are the currencies I believe in. I love being of assistance, just as much as I enjoy diving into a new video game
                        or discovering a hidden gem of a restaurant... That's a little snippet from the tale of my life :)

                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        In my journey through the Foundations of Information Systems, I've embarked on four diverse and insightful projects. 
                        Project 1 challenged me to code a blood pressure checker, simplifying health monitoring for everyday use. 
                        With Project 2, I stepped into the future of logistics, ideating a drone delivery system for a mock company, balancing cost, 
                        efficiency, and innovation. The third project honed my strategic and leadership skills through a Project Management Simulation, 
                        immersing me in the resolution of real-time operational challenges. Lastly, Project 4 was a personal exploration into the nuances of 
                        travel planning. Comparing the traditional travel agent services with the modern, self-planned approach, I navigated through budgeting, 
                        scheduling, and utilizing digital resources, ultimately affirming the value of technology in enhancing our travel experiences.

                    <h3>Project 1 - Blood Pressure Checker Code</h3>
                        
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        During my time at CUNY SPS, there's one project that really stands out. It's not the most complex or impressive piece of code, 
                        but it's special to me because it's the first time I felt like coding could truly simplify life. 
                        This project is a simple Python program—a blood pressure checker.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        The idea behind it was simple too: create a tool that anyone, especially those not familiar with medical jargon, 
                        could use to monitor their blood pressure. We wanted to make it easy, especially for older folks who might find traditional 
                        blood pressure readings confusing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        Here's how it works: you input your systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, the two key numbers for assessing your 
                        blood pressure health. The program then gives you a straightforward, easy-to-understand interpretation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        If your blood pressure is in the healthy range, you get a reassuring message like "Your blood pressure is normal. 
                        Keep up the good work!" It's a small thing, but it can bring peace of mind to anyone worried about their health.
                        But if the readings suggest a potential health issue, the program gently advises you to consult a doctor. 
                        Sometimes, that gentle nudge can be lifesaving.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        For me, this project was a turning point. It was the first time I created code that felt genuinely practical and meaningful in the real world.
                        It wasn't the most advanced code, but it showed me the incredible potential of coding. It's not just about algorithms and syntax; 
                        it's about solving real-world problems and making a positive impact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        As I look back on this project, I can't help but smile. It might be a simple beginner's project, 
                        but it reminds me that even small coding projects can have a big impact. It taught me that coding is a tool for simplifying
                        complex aspects of life, one line of code at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        So, if you ever find yourself struggling with a blood pressure monitor or facing any other everyday challenge, 
                        remember that coding can be the key to making life a little bit easier. It's not just about the code itself; 
                        it's about the difference it can make in people's lives..</p>

                    <p class="text-white-55"> 
                        Jumping into this school project was like a cool adventure, imagining what-if scenarios with the Local Express Delivery Company 
                        as our creative sandbox. We pretended it started back in 2003 and used it to dig into how drones could shake up the package delivery game.                         
                        I got really into picturing a future where drones are buzzing around instead of delivery trucks, especially as tech gets better every day.
                        We looked at how Amazon is doing things and dreamed up a scene where drones are zipping through the sky, dropping off packages in far-off 
                        places super fast—like a 13-minute delivery run in Cambridgeshire.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        I dived into the money-saving and green benefits of our made-up drone program, kind of like the big dreams tech whizzes have. 
                        The project had me figuring out all the nitty-gritty, like how much stuff costs, training people to fly drones, and dealing 
                        with all the rules about flying. I cooked up solutions that felt like the real tough choices businesses face, like shifting 
                        budgets around and changing what jobs people do. It was all about thinking ahead and making smart moves.
                    </p>
    
                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        But this project was more than just coming up with strategies; it was a story about rolling with the punches and what the future of 
                        work might look like. It gave us the chance to write a new chapter on how business and caring for the planet can go hand in hand, 
                        mixing serious study with wild creativity that you usually get to play with in school.
                    </p>    

                    <p class="text-white-55">
                        Looking back, it's clear that we weren't just guessing about what a company's future might hold; we were also getting our heads 
                        around how progress works, blending new ideas with what actually makes sense. Even though we made up the strategies and tech, 
                        it showed how school can get us pumped to think up new ideas. This wasn't just homework; it was a journey through imagination and 
                        the kind of forward-thinking that pushes us forward.

        <h3>Project 3 - Project Management Simulation</h3>

        <img src="assets/Gant-charts.gif" alt="Description of GIF" class="img-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Reflecting on the simulation of "Project Tech at Bankers.x” in my project management studies, I'm filled with a renewed understanding and 
            appreciation for the complexities of managing large-scale projects. This assignment wasn't just an academic exercise; it was an immersive 
            simulation that brought to life the realities and challenges of project management, resonating deeply with my passion for the field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55">
            The scenario presented in this simulation was both daunting and exhilarating: outfitting a rebuilt floor with the latest technology for 
            300 staff, all within a stringent four-week deadline. The thought of managing a simulated budget of $750,000 added a realistic edge to 
            the exercise, challenging me to think critically about resource allocation and cost management.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55">
            I was particularly intrigued by the strategic division of the virtual IT team into specialized groups, each handling aspects like Computing 
            & Accessories, Networking, Telecommunication, and Security. Observing how these groups navigated their tasks in the simulation, adapted to 
            changes, and collaborated was an enlightening insight into the importance of teamwork and specialization in project management.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Progressing through the simulated weeks of the project was a rollercoaster of learning and adaptation. The early phases, marked by rapid advancements, 
            contrasted sharply with the challenges and roadblocks encountered later on, pushing the limits of my problem-solving skills. The extension week in the 
            simulation, where the Computing & Accessories and Security groups faced and overcame technical issues, was particularly instructive.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            That additional week, though part of a hypothetical scenario, was crucial in underscoring the essence of teamwork and determination. The way the team 
            in the simulation rallied together to address compatibility issues, enhance security protocols, and ensure seamless integration of systems was a powerful 
            lesson in the effectiveness of collaborative efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Despite the simulated nature, facing challenges such as technical glitches and scope expansion, which led to a budget overrun in the scenario, taught me 
            the importance of clear and proactive communication in project management.
        </p>   
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Overall, this simulation of Project Tech was more than just an academic assignment; it was an enlightening journey into the heart of project management. 
            It emphasized adaptability, clear communication, and the significance of a cohesive team approach. As a student passionate about project management, this

        <h3>Project 4 - Case Study: Travel Agent VS Self Planning Vacation</h3>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Planning my vacation trip as a class assignment was an exhilarating blend of fun and practicality. 
            Titled "Vacation Trip Planning," this project entailed mapping out a detailed journey across several European cities, including Lisbon, Madrid, 
            and Paris, on a budget of $8,500. As I immersed myself in this project, I found a unique joy in the meticulous process of organizing each aspect 
            of the trip - from choosing flights and accommodations to picking dining spots and sightseeing activities.
        </p>     
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            I compared the traditional use of a travel agent with the more modern, hands-on approach of self-planning. While a travel agent would cost around 
            $250, self-planning amounted to roughly $120 for six hours of my time. This aspect of the project wasn't just enjoyable; it was a real eye-opener 
            about the cost-effectiveness and personalization possible in trip planning today.
        </p>    
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            Diving into the world of online resources like Google, TripAdvisor, and Kayak, I realized how technology has revolutionized the travel planning 
            process. It's fascinating how accessible and efficient trip planning has become, thanks to the internet. This project, while a fun academic exercise, 
            turned out to be a practical demonstration of navigating the digital travel landscape.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            However, it wasn't without its challenges. Balancing the elements of the trip required considerable effort and time. It brought into perspective 
            the value of travel agents, especially for those who might find the process overwhelming or time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-55"> 
            In summary, this project was an adventure in itself, blending the excitement of creating a personalized travel experience with the real-world 
            applicability of digital tools and self-planning. It was a journey through the intricacies of travel logistics, revealing both the joys and challenges
            of modern vacation planning.
